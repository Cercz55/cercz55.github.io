Your cybersecurity team has been alerted to suspicious activity on your organization's network. Several employees reported unusual behavior in their browsers after installing what they believed to be a helpful browser extension named "ChatGPT". However, strange things started happening: accounts were being compromised, and sensitive information appeared to be leaking.

**Your task**Â is to perform a thorough analysis of this extension identify its malicious components.

### Questions

Q1. Which encoding method does the browser extension use to obscure target URLs, making them more difficult to detect during analysis?

= *base64*

This honestly was a long hanging fruit, since the last two characters of the string saved in the 'targets' variable were '='. This is something that happens very often, theorically around 33% of the time.

Q2. Which website does the extension monitor for data theft, targeting user accounts to steal sensitive information?

= www.facebook[.]com (decoded from: `d3d3LmZhY2Vib29rLmNvbQ==`)

One that we identified the encoded string in the target variable, we just have to use Cyberchef to decode it and get the original URL.

Q3. Which type of HTML element is utilized by the extension to send stolen data?

=  `<img>`

In this part of the script, we can see that it takes the image contained in the extension to send the data.

Q4. What is the first specific condition in the code that triggers the extension to deactivate itself?

= *navigator.plugins.length === 0*

Located in the "loader.js" file, which is the first one that runs, we can identify this condition.  
"loader.js" is referenced in the extension's "manifest.js" file, which indicates permissions, name, and more important for us at this moment, scripts that will run in the background. triggering the attack chain of this malicious extension.

Here we can see the condition that checks for virtual environments:

Q5. Which event does the extension capture to track user input submitted through forms?

*= Every 'submit' form that the user receives, will trigger the listener function and exfiltrate the data*

This is an event type from the `.addEventListener` method.

Q6. Which API or method does the extension use to capture and monitor user keystrokes?

*= 'keydown' 

This is an event type from the `.addEventListener` method.

Q7. What is the domain where the extension transmits the exfiltrated data?

*= Mo.Elshaheedy[.]com (currently down)*

In this part of the script, we can see the domain that the data will be exfiltrated to by using the image encoding that we saw previously for obfuscation.

Q8. Which function in the code is used to exfiltrate user credentials, including the username and password?

= *exfiltrateCredentials(username, password);

This function takes username and password as parameters, adds the site hostname for identification, and then creates the payload saved in the payload variable; which gets encrypted after.

Q9. Which encryption algorithm is applied to secure the data before sending?

= *AES*

This script uses AES to encrypt the data. It uses a key that is hard coded, and the data. The now encrypted payload is used then to create a word array and randomize its characters.

Q9. What does the extension access to store or manipulate session-related data and authentication information?

= *cookies*

For this, I had to switch back to `manifest.js`, where I found the permissions that the browser extension had, and noticed that it had access to pretty much everything.

Here, we can see what each of these allow the extension to do, such as monitor all websites, steal login info by capturing the request and so on.

And that would be it.

For reference:
There are multiple ways for scripts to be initialized by the browser, here are the most common ones:
